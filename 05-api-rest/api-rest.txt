Simple API-Rest Example with Go, Mux, and MySQL
This is a simple RESTful API built using Go and the Mux router. It provides basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for managing users. The API communicates with a MySQL database to store and retrieve user data(and sql driver).

Prerequisites:
Before running the API, you will need:

Go installed on your system (version 1.18 or higher).
MySQL database with the same structure as in the previous example: 04-go-mysql.
Air for automatic code reloading during development. Air can be installed from its GitHub repository.
